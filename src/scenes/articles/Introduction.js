        <p>
          For three months I traveled Venezuela’s disputed mining areas. In my
          visits to the Amazonas and Bolívar states I have been confronted with
          illegal armed groups, indigenous communities repressed by Colombian
          guerrillas and enclaves of informal miners tormented by malaria.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problems related to Venezuela’s current crisis such as widespread
          corruption, a lack of cash money, fuel shortages and a general culture
          of fear made fieldwork a rather complicated experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          An illegal detention by the National Guard almost prematurely ended
          this investigation, but the intervention, guidance and support of
          various organizations and individuals made it possible that we can
          present this project. El Correo del Caroni helped with a part of the
          investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this journey, I talked to miners, companies, academics, indigenous,
          politicians and activists and gathered exclusive material on Latin
          America’s most underreported resource conflict.

          <strong>With muddy hands</strong>, a miner throws mineral-rich rocks
          in a spinning mechanic mill that crushes the stones to be processed
          with mercury
        </StoryMedia>. At a small distance, a few soldiers hang around. The
        military escorted us during this visit in the green hills next to El
        Callao, one of many heavily contested mining hotspots in Venezuela. “A
        shootout or a massacre could happen any moment, all days were like
        this,” another miner enthusiastically tells about the violent behaviour
        applied by armed groups that fought for access to this exact mine.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The gold that is extracted will end up on the world market in the form
        of jewelry, locked up in a bank or used in electronics, but few people
        will know about its origin. “They work commando style,” the miner
        continues about nightly shootouts in the hills surrounding the village
        where bullets are shot at every visible headlight as a curfew is imposed
        by active gangs. Most of the miners do not want to be named as they fear
        repercussions from armed actors in the region.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The Venezuelan military also participates in the violence and is often
        involved in mining through associated gangs and its own operations.
        Venezuela’s armed forces received a lot of power during the presidency
        of late Hugo Chávez. Cliver Alcalá Cordones, a Chávez loyalist who
        retired in 2013, was a Major General that held command in the mining
        regions. In a meeting in a hotel lobby in Bogotá, Colombia, he explains
        that Maduro increasingly is handing over functions to the military and
        government sectors that now partake in the “disaster and pillage”.

        What does matter is the impact that the Arco Minero creates. The four
        areas overlap many legally-protected environmental and indigenous
        territories, which likely will dictate their future destruction. Miners
        risk their health and lives as working conditions are unsafe and mining
        areas violently disputed. Damage to the environment is inconsequential
        for the enclaves of subsistence miners and the brutal forces that
        control them, but moreover, is not a factor for the government that
        created a legal framework around digging it all up.

        Alexander Luzardo, a former senator holding a doctorate in political and

        Minero. “The Arco Minero is illegal. It denies the existence and
        creation of protected areas by decree,” Luzardo says in an interview in
        a small coffee shop on the campus of the Central University of Venezuela
        (UCV), in Caracas, where he currently teaches.

        The professor has a very grim prediction for the country. “This is the
        easiest road for environmental destruction in Venezuela. The big
        contribution from Venezuela to the destruction of the planet,” Luzardo
        says. The professor adds that Venezuela had made some impressive
        progress in terms of environmental protection and fears that the Arco

        and the denial of the whole environmental project.”

        There is not much known about mining in the country that has built its
        complete economy on its nationalized oil industry. Now they are tapping
        into another finite resource, because Venezuela not only possesses the
        world's largest oil supplies, the government actually claims to have the
        second biggest gold reserve too. If Venezuela is able to certify the
        deposits, it would undoubtedly be welcome news during the country’s
        darkest hour.

        The country finds itself in a financial and political turmoil since a
        few years already, but current levels of hyperinflation and shortages in
        basic products are driving the economy to rock bottom. The government
        needs sounding solutions, hence the announcement that a significant part
        of the country will be opened for a new motor of economic development:
        mining.

        </ExternalLink>, and the armed forces rule the Arco Minero, which is
        underlined by De Grazia and Luzardo who argue that most of the sector is
        dominated by the military. They extort the gangs that operate the
        illegal mines and control export routes. Mining is a cash machine that
        slowly becomes institutionalized. Last year, the Anonymous Military

          militares are present in about 30 per cent of the state companies

        with known boards of directors. Knowing that the Arco Minero will be
        exploited by joint ventures in which state companies will have a
        majority share, it is very likely the military remain in charge.

      <Paragraph>
        De Grazia says that generals are frequently changed, as are military
        personnel on the boards of companies: “Every military that arrives wants
        to be rich overnight, which makes him more cruel, more violent and his
        norms will be more inhuman because he knows that the form to enrich
        himself is this and that he has one or two months, maybe a year to do
        so.”

          says Alcalá, the retired general who held command in the mining
          regions
        </StoryMedia>. The retired general mentions that many planes illegally
        export a majority of Venezuela’s gold to the Caribbean Islands. The
        military is involved: “They get [the plane] off the radar so they do not
        know where it is.”
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Alcalá confirms that the army receives significant benefits from illegal
        mining and the gangs that operate the projects, where violence is
        applied to maintain control. “Since a year, there have been massacres
        executed by the army in some areas because there is gold.”
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        In the first ten months of 2017, an analysis of press reports by the
        Observatory of Violence and Crime in Bolívar state, shows that at least
        1,415 people have been murdered in said state, many of them in mining
        areas. An accurate estimate of people killed in clashes between violent
        gangs and shootouts with the army is impossible to obtain, as it is not
        unusual that migrant miners, who are not from the region themselves, end
        up in clandestine graves after being murdered in remote regions.

        seems just to have begun. Legalised larceny directly impacts Venezuela
        and its border areas, but the global mineral demand and international
        networks of resource traffickers involve many actors abroad. Therefore,
        the damage that is done to one of the most important ecosystems, the
        Amazon, makes the Arco Minero an issue of international interest.

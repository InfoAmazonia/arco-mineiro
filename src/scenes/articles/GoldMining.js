      <Title as="h2">Unrest in Venezuela’s cradle of gold mining</Title>

      {/* START MAP: Arco Minero (highlight gold areas, zoom in Bolívar) */}

      <Paragraph>Venezuela does not have an elaborate mining history like its neighbours Colombia and Brazil, but if there is one place in the country that traditionally breaths mining it is El Callao. The face of the village in Bolívar state changed forever when gold was discovered in 1853 and it even became the world's <ExternalLink href="https://www.britannica.com/place/El-Callao" language="en">leading gold producer in 1885</ExternalLink>. Various foreign companies operated mines in the area, but it is Minerven, a company created in 1970 and nationalised four years later, that has exploited most gold coming from El Callao.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Local miners tell that working for Minerven meant status and that an employee would wear a company shirt with honor, but things have changed over the last years. Minerven fell into decay. Production plants have been dismantled and the yearly production targets are not met, by far. Meanwhile, many armed groups started to overtake the larger mines that surround the village. About one year ago, the Venezuelan army increasingly militarized the area – for its own gain, many say – and has not stopped combatting gangs and killing its members ever since.</Paragraph>

      {/* PHOTO: Minerven/mining project and soldiers or broken plant of Minerven */}
      {/* START MAP: Arco Minero by areas */}

      <Paragraph>Mining in El Callao belongs to the Arco Minero project. About four mixed companies claim to be part of it, but a visit to El Callao is more than enough to understand that illegal and legal mining go hand in hand. </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Not only is most of the population directly or indirectly involved in the rudimentary extraction of gold, but mining and village life are tangled up. Wherever you are in El Callao, you probably will not have to walk more than a minute to find a gold merchant while it is a more difficult task to encounter a bakery or a supermarket. </Paragraph>

      {/* PHOTO: gold pawn shop */}

      <Paragraph>In the evenings, when most shops close up and when most miners dedicate themselves to their favourite activity – drinking – you will see people sweeping the floor in front of the gold shops, not only to clean, but to find gold. Flakes of gold can be accidently dropped by an uncareful salesman, or small shavings of gold get lost whilst burning the mercury amalgam, an activity that one prefers to do in front of the shop so that the toxic mercury fumes do not remain indoors.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>In 2017, until mid-November the <ExternalLink href="http://desarrollominero.gob.ve/2017/749-kilos-de-oro-sumo-arco-minero-del-orinoco-en-su-decimo-segundo-despacho-en-2017/" language="es">Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) received 5.992kg of gold</ExternalLink>, all from Minerven. “El Callao is maintaining Venezuela,” comments the owner of a gold pawn shop on the central square of the village. However, according to various miners and Minerven personnel interviewed for this report, the gold does not originally come from Minerven, but from the small-scale, and illegal mines.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>“I can’t affirm that Minerven buys from illegal mines, because on paper it’s like like that,” a Minerven source says. “We are authorized to buy from 17 or 18 associations of artisanal gold producers, but we know they buy from illegal miners. That’s how it works now. Every day people are looking to conduct business with us to become legal.”</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Miners explain that only a minor part of Venezuela’s gold production ends up at the BCV. Most of it is smuggled abroad by the army and organized crime. “Six thousand kilos is nothing,” says retired general Cliver Alcalá Cordones. “It goes to Aruba and Curacao.” About 80 per cent of Venezuela’s gold illegally leaves the country by airplanes transporting contraband, according to Alcalá.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Since the 19th century, various international companies, for example from France, the United Kingdom and Russia, entered the region to mine the veins rich in gold that not only surround the village, but run right beneath it. Neighbourhoods around the center slowly became mines. It is not uncommon that a house has a few processing mills in its backyard close to various holes in the ground. These holes must not be misunderstood for bad sewerage, but are mining tunnels that lead to various horizontal mining galleries.</Paragraph>

      {/* PHOTO: processing mills and shafts */}

      <Paragraph>“Confrontations have already been taking place for two years, these occur because there are many mining zones here,” says a local miner from El Callao. “Mining zones are big, they are neighborhoods with mining. If one neighbourhood has too much gold, another neighbourhood wants to enter. Not to work, but to rob with weapons in their hands and to get rid of the people who have gold they want to take.”</Paragraph>

      {/* START MAP: Zoom in El Callao area – satellite imagery */}

      <Paragraph>Villages becomes a mine, and the mines become village. Extended sectors around El Callao are called Colombia, Peru and Chile, amongst other names that were given by previously present foreign mining companies. At the moment, these mines are worked by illegal small-scale miners. They operate under pressure of the local gangs that collaborate with the army. Meanwhile, unknown intruders are fighting for control over the gold mines for years already and have stained El Callao with blood.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>“These gangs are called bases here in the municipality. Before, there were 3 gangs, now there only is one [in charge],” the miner from El Callao explains. Still, various areas count with reminiscences of former gangs. “Small bases are still active between the people.” According to the miner, the ones in El Perú are the most horrific. Encounters occur frequently. In September, before our visit to El Perú, a sector under command by a gangster alias “el Toto”, <ExternalLink href="http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/sucesos/mueren-personas-durante-incursion-del-ejercito-mina-bolivar_669537" language="es">eight people died</ExternalLink> in a confrontation with the army.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Our pick-up truck is driven by Minerven personnel and leaves El Callao to visit the mines, not to show us the ones of Minerven, but to take us to the illegal mines around the village. Here, mineral extraction plants based on the prohibited use of mercury [10MB; PDF] produce gold to sell to the state company.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>“Come with us,” our driver shouts at the local army major, who already is waiting for us in a black jeep. He puts an armed soldier in the back of our truck and escorts us with his own transport. Various military checkpoints are passed before entering El Perú. The area is completely militarized but the danger comes from the hilltops where gangs might come down to take over one of the mines. This luring danger became evident when <ExternalLink href="http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/sucesos/guerra-entre-bandas-sur-bolivar-dejo-seis-muertos_674893" language="es">six locals were killed</ExternalLink> in a gang shootout the night after our visit.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>“If you behave well nothing will happen to you.” One miner who operates a small mill where gold is processed explains that a ‘vaccine’, an extortion fee of 4-5 grams per month for each mill is payed to one of the gangs. With a calm expression on his face he adds: “If not you will go up [into the hills] and they will turn on the chainsaw.” Horror stories about mass graves and dismemberment abound. Gangs are known to come down to the village and disappear people in the surrounding hilltops.</Paragraph>

      {/* 360º PHOTO: Planta de procesamiento El Peru */}

      <Paragraph>Minerven personnel say that more than 30 thousand miners work the gold veins of El Callao and surroundings. Many of them are migrant workers and came to the region as a result of the crisis and a lack of job opportunities elsewhere in the country. One of those workers just crawls outside of a makeshift tunnel, followed by his 15-year old nephew. “If I do not work in the mines, I do not have a way to maintain my family,” the former carpenter says.</Paragraph>

      {/* YOUTUBE EMBED: Vicente and his nephew climb out of a tunnel */}

      <Paragraph>Close to him Minorca Maurera is resting, she is a 23-year single mom who worked in a bakery before she came to El Callao. “The minimum wage just doesn’t cut it for me. I’m a single mother of three children. I resigned [from the bakery] because of the low wage and came to this place. It is a bit tough, but I’ve been doing quite well. Independently, I can maintain my children now.”</Paragraph>

      {/* YOUTUBE EMBED: Interview with Minorca */}

      <Paragraph>Dusty slum-like neighbourhoods with dispersed and small makeshift wooden shacks that just have a thin corrugated roof are filled with mining migrants, but also with El Callao natives. More than a century-and-half of gold extraction has brought the local population anything but riches, which even makes a hardcore Chavista wary of the Arco Minero.</Paragraph>

      {/* START MAP: Zoom in El Callao area – satellite imagery */}

      <Paragraph>“The Arco Minero, practically has functioned to cover up many things,” says Darwin Lizardi Tabor. The 28-year old is the local coordinator of the youth branch of the United Socialist Party (PSU), the government party, and wears a red Minerven cap when we meet him. “The Arco Minero as such has not functioned, man. I will tell you that I’m a revolutionary Chavista, but you need to tell the things as they are. This is camouflage here. I don’t know why. Because in the end it’s hurting us as miners and the village.”</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Lizardi is proudly El Callao-born but times have changed. He explains that his mother grew up in quieter times. “This was when you could leave the door of your house open all night, nobody would enter.” Lizardi’s 66-year old mother now considers leaving the place they both carry in their heart. </Paragraph>

      {/* PHOTO: A little gold (IMG_4490) */}

      <Paragraph>Violence and poverty make El Callao a difficult place to live. “The miner is still the dirty one that walks on street. He earns 300 thousand bolívares, drinks a beer and the next day he has nothing and needs to find 0.3 or 0.4 grams of gold to bring food back to his home. A miner should not live like this if the Arco Minero really was functioning.”</Paragraph>

      {/* YOUTUBE EMBED: Going down with an elevator */}

      <Paragraph>We continue to speak in a bar closed to outsiders, as miners and alcohol can be a very explosive combination. Lizardi orders new beers as he continues his discourse about the lack of state infrastructure and medicines while the locals hand over their gold to the government. “Thanks to the miner, the one that goes down into a tunnel of 100-120 meters, thanks to this miner the state has four tons of gold.”</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>The Arco Minero received a lot of criticism in the Venezuelan press, mainly because of its future environmental impact, gang involvement and presence in indigenous territories. In October, the state’s Ministry of Information went on the counter-attack and published an article that <ExternalLink href="http://desarrollominero.gob.ve/2017/criminalizacion-mediatica-deforma-la-verdad-del-arco-minero-del-orinoco/" language="es">blames the press of criminalizing the small-scale miners</ExternalLink> and of overlooking the fact that 250 thousand people directly or indirectly depend on the Arco Minero. In El Callao, where miners make their own money since they were young, the benefits of the Arco Minero are hard to perceive.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>“All the gold would be invested in social work in the municipality of El Callao and now, not even an ambulance has arrived,” explains Lizardi, who says the people of El Callao have been promised a lot by the government. “Minerven already has the money from the state to buy the gold from the small miners. What Minerven practically does is to pick up the gold and bring it to the Central Venezuelan Bank. They are not assuming their role as a mining company because all their plants are halted.”</Paragraph>

      {/* YOUTUBE EMBED: Gutiérrez at work and with mercury */}

      <Paragraph>Having your income determined by luck and hard work instead of just working hours is an integral part of mining culture. “At the moment nobody receives a wage. You work to get the gold and the money is yours,” says Eduardo Gutiérrez. A 43-year old from El Callao who works at one of the processing mills in El Perú.</Paragraph>

      {/* PHOTO: Bottle of mercury */}

      <Paragraph>Gutiérrez is satisfied with the price the state company Minerven pays for his gold and he hopes that the Arco Minero project will send him more resources and equipment, but a safe working environment is still lacking. Bare handedly Gutiérrez touches the water mixed with mercury as he scrapes a mass of gold amalgam from a plate. Consecutively, he heats the residue with a gas burner to isolate the gold, but makes no effort to cover his face from the toxic mercury fumes.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Various scientists already sounded the alarm about mercury pollution in El Callao causing neurological problems for the miners [3.8MB; PDF], but also leading to cases of <ExternalLink href="http://www.autismoava.org/noticias/el-veneno-silencioso-de-el-callao" language="es">autism in young children</ExternalLink>.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Neurological disorders, kidney-, lung- and skin problems are most the common health consequences of mercury contamination, says Marianella Herrera, the director of the Venezuelan Health Observatory in Caracas. “One important problem is the exposure to mercury for pregnant woman in the first stages of life, also, researchers have connected heavy metals exposure, as mercury, to autism.”</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>A study carried out in various mining areas in Bolívar state found that only <ExternalLink href="http://www.spda.org.pe/wpfb-file/la-realidad-de-la-mineria-ilegal-en-paises-amazonicos-spda-pdf/" language="es">32 per cent of the children had mercury levels below the safety limit</ExternalLink> in their blood.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Severe health problems, bloody gang battles and military controlled areas. Illegal gold mining in El Callao contributed to unsafe and unhealthy circumstances, but the Arco Minero has a stake in it all. “All the gold that arrives at Minerven is legal, on paper, even if it’s illegal,” Lizardi explains. </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>The sector has been taken over by gangs and the army. Illegally mined gold is bought up by legal ‘mining’ companies that are actually not mining the gold themselves, which essentially means they function as a large gold pawn shop. “Here in El Callao we have too much gold, but we do not have the machines nor the resources necessary to really be able [to mine it all],” boasts Darwin.</Paragraph>

      {/* START MAP: Zoom in Nacupay area – satellite imagery */}
      {/* PHOTO: MunSol (El Callao-78) */}

      <Paragraph>The obscure symbiosis between legal and illegal mining is almost too obvious. On the other side of the village we are taken to a gang controlled mine called “Nacupay”. Before entering the area we are told to “not take pictures of armed men” nor of mercury-using mining machinery. Just before the entrance, a sign says MunSol – “Mining enterprise affiliated to the Bolivarian homeland in the Arco Minero del Orinoco”. Behind the sign we find dozens of informal miners working in the muddy open-air pits.</Paragraph>

      {/* YOUTUBE EMBED: Artisan miners */}

      <Paragraph>We are only allowed to take pictures of miners working with washing boards, characteristic for artisanal mining operations, they don’t want us to show nor document the larger installations. We are still able to photograph the camps the miners live in, next to the mining pits filled with stagnant and contaminated water.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>The situation in El Callao is not an exception. About 91 per cent of the gold mined in Venezuela is reported to be illegal, according to a research by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime [10.8MB; PDF]. Small batches of gold are turned into jewelry and then smuggled to, for example, the Caribbean Islands. Just as in different parts of Venezuela, the corrupt army transports larger batches to coastal routes, Colombia and Brazil. </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Just a minor part of the gold ends up in the hands of the state. This shows, as Lizardi mentioned before, how the Arco Minero so far functions as a facade. “I remember when Commander Chávez spoke about the Arco Minero [in 2011] and the Bolívar state should become a potency in Venezuela. We would not depend on petroleum!”, the youngster – who so far is disillusioned with the Arco Minero – says. “Here, things are happening and the Arco Minero has functioned to cover up corruption within the government.”</Paragraph>
